# Thyroid Analysis

## Overview
Thyroid Analysis is a project designed to analyze and predict thyroid-related disorders using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes medical datasets to classify thyroid conditions, aiding in early detection and diagnosis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Prediction of thyroid conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, normal)
- Visualization of key metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Dataset
The project utilizes a thyroid dataset containing medical records with relevant features such as TSH, T3, and T4 levels. The dataset may be obtained from publicly available medical sources or proprietary clinical data.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thyroid-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd thyroid-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare and clean the dataset.
2. Run exploratory data analysis.
3. Train the machine learning model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
5. Deploy the model using a web interface (if applicable):
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Results
The model provides predictions on thyroid conditions based on input medical data. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess effectiveness.
